# Bayesian Analysis Lab

We used the following three datasets for our work throughout this repository:
 * [AB_Dataset](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/ab_data_v2.xlsx)
 * [MIMIC3D_Dataset](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/MIMIC3D_DataSet/mimic3d_v3.csv)
 * [Patients.csv](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/PATIENTS_DataSet/Patient.csv) **TO BE UPDATED WHEN THE FILE HAS BEEN CLEANED AND UPLOADED**

In addition to the datasets above, we also used the following subsets for task 1:
 * [Subsets](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/task_1/subsets.xlsx)
 * [Subsets - Treatment](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/task_1/subsets_treatment.xlsx)
 * [Subsets - Control](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/task_1/subsets_control.xlsx)

## How This Website Works

There are 5 main sections in this repository, meaning there is a section for each of the 5 assigned tasks. If you follow the first link below, you will be able to maneuver continuously throughout this website. **Hover over the graphs for an interactive experience!**

## Project Tasks

Located in the "[Issues](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/issues)" section. Each task has an "assignee", or the person the task was completed by. Tasks with multiple assignees were completed in collaboration. There is a filter on the top right to look at specific assignees and what they have worked on.

## Datasets, Functions, and More!

Throughout the website, you will have access to the datasets and the codes we used to produce our results. Feel free to take a look although it is not necessary to generally understand our results.
